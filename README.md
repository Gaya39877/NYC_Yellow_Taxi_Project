## 📁 Data Pipeline Stages

### 1. **Data Source**
- Source: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)
- Data Format: Parquet

### 2. **Landing Stage**
- Raw data stored in Parquet format.
- Serves as the initial storage point within Microsoft Fabric.

### 3. **Staging**
- **Tables**: `stg.nyctaxi_yellow`, `stg.taxi_zone_lookup`
- Data is copied from the landing zone using **Copy Data Activity**.
- Staging stores unrefined datasets for further transformation.

### 4. **Presentation Layer**
- **Table**: `dbo.nyctaxi_yellow`
- Data is transformed and cleaned using **Dataflow Gen2 Activity**.
- Optimized for analytics and business intelligence.

### 5. **Reporting**
- A **semantic model** is built on top of the presentation layer.
- **Power BI** is used for interactive reporting and visualizations.
